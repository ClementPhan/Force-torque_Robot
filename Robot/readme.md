#### Robot oriented side of the project

The RAPID server was made possible thanks to the code made available by the folks at open_ABB (https://github.com/robotics/open_abb). Great thanks to them for their amazing work !

The code for our project is available in [this folder](Code_Rapid), whereas the backup for our functionning robot simulation is [here](StationRobotStudio/Station_Projet)
